# Upcoming
Analysing how closely related different coronaviruses are by comparing their genomes using the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm (global alignment) coupled with banded alignment to save time.

# Running the Visualization
In the Coronaviruses-analysis directory, run the following command: "python -m http.server". The visualization should be running on port 8000, and can be seen by going to "http://localhost:8000/Visualization/".

# Running the Analysis
All of the analysis is in a Jupyter notebook called "Analysis.ipynb".
